  In Cloth constructor, register an event listener for event "keydown", which executes
  handleImpactEvents() when any key is pressed.
  In handleImpactEvents(), I first determine which arrow key is pressed by accessing the key
  field of event with the ; if the key pressed is not an arrow key or the particle looked at
  is out of the cloth, do nothing.
  Then, calculate the offset based on the key pressed and update the position of the particle
  looked at.
<ul>
  <li> "ArrowUp": Move the looked-at particle upwards.
  <li> "ArrowDown": Move the looked-at particle downwards.
  <li> "ArrowLeft": Move the looked-at particle leftwards.
  <li> "ArrowRight": Move the looked-at particle rightwards.
</ul>

I implemented the structural, shearing and bending constraints by iterating through
the particles on the cloth in row-major order and create new constraints between
the particle and its neighbors. The new constraints are stored in this.constraints.

<p><hr><p><a name='Constraints'></a><h2>Constraints</h2><p><hr><p>
In Constraint.enforce(), I computed the correction vector based on the actual distance between
the two particles (by accessing the positions) and the desired rest distance (by accessing this.distance).
Then I apply half the correction vector to each particle, negate the direction when needed so that
the vector points to the other particle and thus brings the two particles closer.
Then, in Cloth.enforceConstraints, I iterate through this.constraints and call enforce()
for each element.

<p><hr><p><a name='Gravity'></a><h2>Gravity</h2><p><hr><p>
First, in Particle.addForce, add the force in the parameter to the force field of the particle.
Then, in Cloth.applyGravity, I first computed the acceleration vector due to gravity. Then I computed
the gravity force by multiplying the acceleration with the mass of the particle. Finally I
added the gravity force to each particle of the cloth.

<p><hr><p><a name='Verlet+integration'></a><h2>Verlet integration</h2><p><hr><p>
I first computed the new position for the particle using Verlet integration. I then saved the
current position in this.previous, and set this.position to the new position computed. Finally, I
reset the netForce of the particle to zero.

<p><hr><p><a name='Floor+collision'></a><h2>Floor collision</h2><p><hr><p>
In Particle.handleFloorCollision(), whenever the particle gets below the floor,
I reset its y coordinate to be above the floor. Then I call the function in Cloth.handleCollisions()
for each particle of the cloth.

<p><hr><p><a name='Sphere+collision'></a><h2>Sphere collision</h2><p><hr><p>
  In Particle.handleSphereCollision(), I first check if the particle is inside the sphere.
  If so, I find posNoFriction of its projection on the sphere's surface. If the particle was outside of the sphere
  in the last time interval, I compute posFriction with the sphere's vector which is the particle's last
  position. Then I linearly interpolate posNoFriction and posFriction and update the position of the particle. If the particle was instead inside the sphere in the previous interval,
  ignore posFriction.
  Then I call the function in Cloth.handleCollisions() for each particle of the cloth.

<p><hr><p><a name='Box+collision'></a><h2>Box collision</h2><p><hr><p>
  In Particle.handleBoxCollision(), I first check if the particle is inside the box (using the fields of THREE.Box3).
  If so, I find posNoFriction of its projection on the closest surface of the box. If the particle was outside of the box
  in the last time interval, I compute posFriction with the particle's last
  position. Then I linearly interpolate posNoFriction and posFriction and use the result to update the position of the particle. If the particle was inside the box in the previous interval,
  ignore posFriction.
  Then I call the function in Cloth.handleCollisions() for each particle of the cloth.

handleClickEvents(): This event listener responds to the mouse click. When the mouse
clicks somewhere on the cloth, all the particles of the cloth are pushed away from the particle.

applyRain(): I first computed the impulse vector due to the rain using the parameter given.
Then, I select a random particle on the cloth and apply the offset vector. I also apply a weaker impulse
to the particles that are next to the random particle. Repeat the process until "rate" number
of random particles are selected.
